### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Philipp, I'm a data engineer at [@nyris](https://github.com/nyris). My main interests are computer vision ðŸ‘€ and anything that has the word data in it.

I enjoy making useless tools to automate useless tasks, configuring neovim and look for a rust replacement to every program. I also am very interested in reinforcement learning and tried to make my computer play video games multiple times.

I worked as a data scientist, focusing on deep learning and computer vision, data engineer handling any type of data and I think I would like to work as a software engineer in the future.

Through my experience with programming I mastered python, touched C++ a bit,  tried to get better at rust for 5 years straight and now am looking to learn C# and .NET.
